"""
Module to allow for reading lines from a continuously-growing file (such as
a system log). Handles log files that get rotated/trucated out from under
us. Inspired by the Perl File::Tail module.

Example:

  t = filetail.Tail("log.txt")
  while True:
      line = t.nextline()
      # do something with the line

or:

  t = filetail.Tail("log.txt")
  for line in t:
      # do something
      pass

               the beginning of the file when first opened. Set only_new to
               True to have it skip to the end when it first opens, so that
               you only get the new additions that arrive after you start
               monitoring. 
             min_sleep: Shortest interval in seconds to sleep when waiting
               for more input to arrive. Defaults to 1.0 second.
             sleep_interval: The tail monitor will dynamically recompute an
               appropriate sleep interval based on a sliding window of data
               arrival rate. You can set sleep_interval here to seed it
               initially if the default of 1.0 second doesn't work for you
               and you don't want to wait for it to converge.
             max_sleep: Maximum interval in seconds to sleep when waiting
               for more input to arrive. Also, if this many seconds have
               elapsed without getting any new data, the tail monitor will
               check to see if the log got truncated (rotated) and will
               quietly reopen itself if this was the case. Defaults to 60.0
               seconds.
